<!-- A 3d-hover-effect link -->
<script src="js/hover3D.js"></script>
</head>

<!-- A user's hover3D settings -->
<script src="js/myHover3D.js"></script>
</body>
```

## How to create 3D hover effect
Easy and quick. It's just a single line of code!

// of HTML element(s) you want to create the effect to.
let myHover3D = new Hover3D(".card"); // Yep! That's it.
```
## How to customize it
You have a bunch of properties you can tweak to control the effect.
```javascript
// X-axis offset
myHover3D.xOffset = 3
// Y-axis offset
myHover3D.yOffset = 3
// Attack. How fast the effect reacts to cursor movement
myHover3D.attack = 0.1
// Release. How fast an element repairs its initial state
myHover3D.release = 0.5
